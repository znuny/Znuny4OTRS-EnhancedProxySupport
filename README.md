Znuny4OTRS - Enhanced Proxy Support
===================================
You use the OTRS http/ftp proxy support to access external RSS feeds and other resources but you want also to use local http/ftp resources (e. g. local package manager as OPM repository). But you have problems to configure this, because you need both (http/ftp proxy for external and just some URL's/host's not).

Feature List
============
* Allow to defined host's/URL's in OTRS where no proxy should be used.

Configuration
=============
* Defined the list in Admin-Interface -> SysConfig -> Group: Framework -> Subgroup: Core::WebUserAgent -> WebUserAgent::NoProxy

Installation
============
Download the package and install it via admin interface -> package manager.

Prerequisites
* OTRS 3.0
* OTRS 3.1
* OTRS 3.2
